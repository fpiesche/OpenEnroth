We are creating an extensible engine & modding environment that would make it possible to play original Might & Magic VI-VIII
games on modern platforms with improved graphics and quality-of-life features expected of modern titles, and make modding and
installing & playing the mods a pleasurable experience.

Currently only MM7 is playable. You can check out the [milestones](https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/milestones) to see where we're at.

# Download

To download the code without having to compile it we have our releases at [https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/releases](https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/releases) 

Currently there are only the nightly builds which may have bugs.

# Getting Started

Regardless of what system you want to play OpenEnroth on, you will need a copy of OpenEnroth and the Might and Magic VII
game data. Where and how you install these on your computer depends on your operating system.

## Getting the game data

You can buy Might and Magic VII from [gog.com](https://www.gog.com/en/game/might_and_magic_7_for_blood_and_honor) and
download the installer from there; if you have a copy from another source (eg. an original retail disc) this should
also work with OpenEnroth.

At the very least, OpenEnroth requires the `ANIMS`, `DATA`, `MUSIC` and `SOUNDS` directories from the game data.

### Non-GOG versions

Install or extract your copy of the game as normal.

### GOG Version

#### Windows

On Windows, you can simply run the installer to extract the game data to your computer.

#### Linux and macOS

The installer cannot be run directly on Linux and macOS but you can use `innoextract` to extract its contents.

* On macOS, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't have it already (run `brew --version` in a Terminal
  window to see if you do) and install `innoextract` using `brew install innoextract`
* On Linux, the exact command depends on your distribution.
  * For Ubuntu or Debian-based systems (including eg. Linux Mint, Pop!OS, etc): `sudo apt install -y innoextract`
  * For Fedora or other RedHat-based systems (*except* for "immutable" distributions like Bazzite): `sudo dnf install -y innoextract`
  * For other systems, please check the distribution's user guide. [Repology](https://repology.org/project/innoextract/versions)
    has an extensive list of Linux distributions and the name of the package for innoextract on each.

Once you have innoextract, create a new directory for the game data, then open a terminal window and run:

`innoextract -e -d <new game data directory> <path to GOG installer .exe>`

This will extract the game data to the new directory.

## Installing OpenEnroth

### Windows

1. Download one of the prebuilt [releases](https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/releases) and unzip the files.
2. Copy `OpenEnroth.exe` and `OpenEnroth.pdb` to the directory containing the game data.
3. Run `OpenEnroth.exe`.


### macOS

1. Move the game data to `~/Library/Application Support/OpenEnroth`, creating this directory if needed.
2. Download one of the prebuilt [releases](https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/releases) and unzip the files.
3. Run `xattr -rc <extracted-path>/dist/OpenEnroth.app`. This is needed because OpenEnroth binaries are unsigned, without this step the app bundle won't start.
4. Run `OpenEnroth.app`.


### Linux

There are two options on Linux - loose executables to install wherever you like and a Flatpak package for ease of use. The key differences are:

The Flatpak package is somewhat easier to use:
  * Includes all the necessary dependencies to run OpenEnroth; this is useful if your system does not have the required libraries available
    or the available versions are incompatible with the loose executable bundle
  * Requires the game data to be in a specific location
  * Can be used e.g. on a Steam Deck or on "immutable"/"atomic" Linux distributions like [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/) or [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/).

The loose executable bundle is more flexible:
  * May require you to install some libraries to your operating system
  * Both the game executable and data can be installed anywhere on your computer

#### Flatpak

1. Check for Flatpak support:
   * Run `flatpak --version`.
   * If you receive a message listing a version number, you're ready to go; otherwise check [https://flatpak.org/setup/](https://flatpak.org/setup/)
     and follow instructions there to set up.
2. Install OpenEnroth:
   * Download the `io.github.openenroth.openenroth_*.flatpak` package from one of the
     prebuilt [releases](https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/releases).
   * Run `flatpak install --user /path/to/io.github.openenroth.openenroth_*.flatpak` to install the OpenEnroth package.
   * Create `~/.var/app/io.github.openenroth/openenroth/data/mm7`
   * Move the game data (at least the `ANIMS`, `DATA`, `MUSIC` and `SOUNDS` directories) to this new directory
3. Run OpenEnroth from your desktop's application menu or using `flatpak run io.github.openenroth.openenroth`

#### Loose executables

1. Install the required libraries SDL2, `libdwarf` and `libelf`:
   * `sudo apt-get install libsdl2 libdwarf libelf` (Ubuntu/Debian)
   * `sudo dnf install SDL2 libdwarf elfutils-libelf` (RedHat/Fedora)
   * For other distributions, check your distribution's user guides
2. Install OpenEnroth:
   * Download one of the prebuilt [releases](https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/releases) and unzip the files.
   * Create a new directory for your OpenEnroth installation and copy the `dist/OpenEnroth` executable from the zip there
   * Copy the game data (at least the `ANIMS`, `DATA`, `MUSIC` and `SOUNDS` directories) to your OpenEnroth directory
4. Run the `OpenEnroth` executable (you may need to run `chmod a+x OpenEnroth` first).

# Game Assets Path Override

<<<<<<< HEAD
You can set `OPENENROTH_MM7_PATH` env variable to point to the location of the game assets. If this variable is set,
OpenEnroth will look for game assets only in the location it's pointing to. You might also want to add the following
line to your bash profile (e.g. `~/.profile` on Ubuntu or `~/.zshrc` on Mac):
=======
2. Move extracted game assets to `~/Library/Application Support/OpenEnroth`. This is where `OpenEnroth` will look for game data.

3. Download one of the prebuilt [releases](https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth/releases) and unzip the files.
   
4. Run `xattr -rc <extracted-path>/dist/OpenEnroth.app`. This is needed because OpenEnroth binaries are unsigned, without this step the app bundle won't start.

5. Start `OpenEnroth.app`.


Game Assets Path Override
-------------------------

You can set `OPENENROTH_MM7_PATH` env variable to point to the location of the game assets. If this variable is set, OpenEnroth will look for game assets only in the location it's pointing to. You might also want to add the following line to your bash profile (e.g. `~/.profile` on Ubuntu):
>>>>>>> upstream/master

```
export OPENENROTH_MM7_PATH="<path-to-mm7-game-assets>"
```
